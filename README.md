# Question Variant Generator

This app is intended for educators and helps them generate multiple versions of their quiz questions using GenAI.

The teachers upload quiz questions in a TSV file, and the app will automatically generate 2 new variants for each question.
The output file with the 2 variants for each question can then be downloaded as a csv file with the click of a button.
